Bouncy Ball
If it touches the wall, it bounces. A basic, simple figure. While it is easy that getting bonus points from it, beware its occasional rush mode.
Snake Square
While it moves to the left constantly, it randomly changes its vertical position. Getting near it is never a good choice. Also, do not trust the randomness of the computer.
Spin Ball
Going right, spinning a lot. It's hard to avoid even if I notice its existance. It would go diagonally after a while.
Mine Ball
A number of this spread all over the field, and explode after some time. It's not that hard to avoid, but its explosion remains long. It gives many points.
Spear Square
Charge into the upper wall from the bottom really fast. It's impossible to avoid after its charging. Keep an eye on the bottom of the field. Its cooldown decreases after a while.
Cannon Square
Launches a dangerous Cannonball from both sides. Cannonball gives me many points. Since Cannonball flies straight, it's fairly easy to avoid.
Laser Square
Shoots a laser. REALLY long laser. The laser is straight, so it really doesn't matter much. Another my point supplement.
Slow Crystal
Generates a blue square that makes me slower. In addition, it makes a noisy sound if someone doesn't touch it. Touch and break it immediately.
Chasing Ball
It chases me three times. It towards to the spot where I was right before it charges. Mind the timing, and dodge. Small movement would be enough; large movement brings risk.
Sniper Ball
Aim at me, and shoots itself really fast. It takes about 2~4 seconds to shoot. Watch the aim mark blinking in red and listen to the sound it makes.
